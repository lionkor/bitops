# bitops

A collection of abstractions for common bitwise operations, including tests.

## How to build & use

bitops is a pure header-only little library. To use it, include the `bitops.h` and that's it. All functions are templated, so they work with any type that supports bitwise operations.

The tests can be built by running `cmake . && make`. They can be executed with `./all_tests` after that.
